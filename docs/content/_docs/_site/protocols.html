<h2>Protocols</h2>

<p>
Any software program on the host can send measurements directly to Fast Forward by formatting a message and sending it to the appropriate port. 

There are two main protocols for sending metrics to FFWD are Protobuf and JSON. 

Protobuf protocol is exposed on port 19091 UDP and JSON protocol is exposed on port 19000 UDP. 

The tagging in the message must follow the conventions described above for source application tags and semantic-metrics tags.
